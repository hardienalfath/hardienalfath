# Hardien Alfath's Portfolio

Hello and Welcome to my portfolio page

Here is a list of the projects that I have done:

1. On 21 November 2022, a magnitude 5.6 SR earthquake struck the city of Cianjur, West Java, Indonesia and the nearby areas. By utilizing ESA Snap python module snappy, the works will explore about the interferogram creation that is useful for further earthquake analysis from a pair of Sentinel-1A SAR constellation, before and after the earthquake happened.
