# Hardien Alfath's Portfolio

Hello and Welcome! My name is Hardien a Geoinformatics Engineer, and I have worked mostly with geospatial data. This portfolio is aimed to showcase the projects that I did, which of course mostly correlate towards Geospatial use case.

Without further do here is a list of the projects:

1. On 21 November 2022, a magnitude 5.6 SR earthquake struck the city of Cianjur, West Java, Indonesia and the nearby areas. By utilizing ESA Snap python module snappy, the works will explore about the interferogram creation that is useful for further earthquake analysis from a pair of Sentinel-1A SAR constellation, before and after the earthquake happened.
